# The Trojan-Horse
## A simple trojan written in the C programming language.

### Description
This trojan, when executed will eat up the hard disk space on the root drive (The drive on which the Windows is installed, usually C: Drive) of the computer on which it is run. 

Also, this trojan works pretty quickly and is capable of eating up approximately 1 GB of hard disk space for every minute it is run.
So, I’ll call this: "The Glutton!"
Since this program is written using a high level programming language, it is often undetected by antivirus programs. 

### Let’s move on to the working of The-Glutton-Trojan:
This trojan disguises itself as an antivirus program that scans the computer for malware. 
However, in reality it does nothing other than eating up the hard disk space on the root drive by filling it up with a huge junk file.
The rate at which it fills up the hard disk space is very high. 
As a result, the root drive gets filled up completely with in minutes of running The-Glutton!
    
Once the disk is full the trojan reports that the scan is complete. 
The victim will not be able to clean up the hard disk using any of the cleanup programs. 
This is because, The-Glutton intelligently creates a huge file in the Windows\System32 folder with the .dll extension. 
Since the junk file has the .dll extension it is often ignored by the disk cleanup software. 
Hence there is now way to recover the hard disk space other than reformatting the drive.
Sounds like a B!7C# Right!
    
### The algorithm of the Trojan is as follows:
    1. Search for the root drive.

    2. Navigate to the following location on the root drive.

        %systemroot%\Windows\System32
    
    3. Create the file named “spceshot.dll“.

    4. Start dumping the junk data onto the above file and keep increasing its size until the drive is full.

    5. Once the drive is full, stop the process.

#### Please note that I have not included the executable for security reasons. 
#### You need to compile it to obtain the executable.

###### NOTE: You can also change the ICON of the virus to make it look like a legitimate program.


### How to test this trojan horse?
    To test The-Glutton, just run the SpaceEater.exe file on your computer. 
    It will generate a warning message at the beginning. 
    Once you accept it, the Trojan runs and eats up the hard disk space.

###### NOTE: I have purposefully added this warning screen to avoid script kiddies from misusing it. 
###### However you can edit the source code and then recompile it to remove the warning…

### How to fix the damage and free up the space?
    To remove the damage and free up the space, just type the following in the “run” dialog box:
    
    %systemroot%\system32
	
    Now search for the file “spceshot.dll“. 
    Just delete it and you’re done. No need to re-format the hard disk.
