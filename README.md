# Malware

Iâ€™m fascinated by the impact that individuals and teams can have on the dynamics between IT defenders and online threat actors.
The purpose of this project is purely to sharing knowledge. This is my first github contrabution and exists as the resut of my independent research into technology, and cybersecurity. 
I believe that the industry is still relatively immature, and even small efforts can make a big difference. So I publish this in the hopes of advancing my understanding of cybersecurity tradecraft whilst contributing to the community.
As the language of cybersecurity evolves in step with changes in attack and defense tactics, here is some of my work which can be used either as data or a computing resource. I welcome any assistance as I am currently the sole contributor.

If you'd like to start experimenting with malware analysis in your own lab, you can use this repo to get a sense of information security threats. Be careful not to infect yourself when accessing and experimenting with malicious software.
All responsibilities are at your own risk. 

Please use it only for research purposes.
